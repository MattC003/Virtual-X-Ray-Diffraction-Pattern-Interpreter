# Virtual-X-Ray-Diffraction-Pattern-Interpreter

This repository contains materials related to a **senior design research project** focused on applying **machine learning to interpret X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns** for materials science applications.

The project was completed at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)** and involved large-scale data processing, model development, and scientific analysis.

## Project Overview

- Over **10 terabytes of simulation data** were generated and processed using **UConn’s High Performance Computing (HPC) resources**.
- Molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate XRD patterns under extreme temperature conditions.
- Machine learning models were trained to **predict material phase fractions** directly from XRD data.
- The resulting models automate and accelerate analysis that traditionally requires expert manual interpretation.

The workflow and results of this project are summarized in the included **research poster**, which explains the data pipeline, models, and final outcomes.

## Code Availability

**Source code is not included**

The implementation code for this project cannot be publicly shared. The codebase was developed as part of a **research initiative** and has been provided to the **University of Connecticut for continued development and future use**.

To respect ongoing research and institutional use, this repository serves as a **public-facing summary** of the project rather than a full code release.
